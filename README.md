# ECE 0301 – C++ Programming Projects

This repository contains C++ code written by **Lucas Bucht** for **ECE 0301: Problem Solving with C++** at the University of Pittsburgh.  
In this course, I develop procedural and object-oriented programs to solve engineering problems—often tied to other ECE topics like circuits, systems, and math. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Course Tools & Environment

- **Language:** C++  
- **Development:** Code compiled and run using your preferred compiler (e.g., `g++`, Visual Studio, etc.)  
- **Testing:** Use of unit tests, command-line testing, or simple driver programs  
- **Build / Run Instructions:** (Optional — you can list how to compile or run each project)

## Repository Structure

Each project folder typically contains:

- **`.cpp` / `.h`** — C++ source and header files  
- **`tests/`** — Unit test code or test drivers  
- **`README.md`** (optional) — Per-project notes, design decisions, how it ties to ECE concepts  
- **`build/` or `bin/`** — (Optional) compiled executables, if you include them

## How to Use This Code

1. Browse the **Project Index** above to find the code you want.  
2. Clone or download the folder.  
3. Compile the C++ source files using your local or cloud C++ toolchain.  
4. Run test drivers or unit tests (if provided) to verify behavior.  
5. Review comments or documentation in each folder to understand how the code maps to ECE 0301 course concepts.

## Purpose & Learning Goals

Through these assignments, I aim to:

- Practice **procedural programming** (loops, conditionals, data structures)  
- Use **object-oriented programming** (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- Apply **fundamental algorithms** (sorting/searching, basic data structures)  
- Solve real engineering problems (e.g., circuit calculations, system simulations) tied to other ECE coursework :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
